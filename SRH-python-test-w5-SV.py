# Big Data Programming: Pyhton Module Test
# Instructions ...
# Please consider good style & naming while developing the code when necessary,
#  such as Docstring, linting, etc. it is considered in the grading process!
# Use this file for the solution only. Jupyter notebook(.ipynb) not acceptable!
# Push the solution to a remote repo of name "SRH-Python-Test", and send me the link of the repo as DM
#  on Ms Teams for assessment.
# The duration of this test is 1 hour.

# Q1: What is the main difference between the list and Tuple?
# Answer : List consists of elements within squred braces [] with '' or "". 
# Example : fruits = ["Apple","Banana","Orange"] and is mutable.
# Tuple consists of elements in () with '' or "", which is an orederd is list and immutable.
# example : x = (1,2,3)


# Q2: why should list indexing be used Python?
# Answer : List indexing starts from 0 for the first element. 
# List indexing is important to address each of the element that is present in the list.
# ex : fruits = ["Apple","Banana","Orange"] and fruits [0] will return apple.



# Q3: You have two lists (string_list, values_list) below. Write a function of
#  a name count_car. The function returns a dictionary.
#  The expected return of the function should print out this dictionary:
#  {'Audi_Q5': 2, 'Honda_civic': 4, 'Mercedes_200E': 5, 'BMW_720': 7, 'VW_passat': 2}
string_list = ['Audi_Q5', 'Honda_civic', 'Mercedes_200E', 'Honda_civic',
               'BMW_720', 'VW_passat']

value_list = [2, 4, 5, 7, 2]

def count_car(string_list, value_list):
    # initialize dict to add the values
    car_count = {}
    
    # move over string list and value list
    for car, value in zip(string_list, value_list):
        if car in car_count:
            car_count[car] +=value  
        else:
            car_count[car] =value 
    
    return car_count

string_list = ['Audi_Q5', 'Honda_civic', 'Mercedes_200E', 'Honda_civic',
               'BMW_720', 'VW_passat']
value_list = [2, 4, 5, 7, 2]

#print the result on calling the function
result = count_car(string_list, value_list)
print(result)




# Q4: Write a function of a name double_even_numbers. Â .
#  The function has one argument which is a numpy array of 100 elements of
#  integer type between 0-10.
#  The function returns an array. Use list comprehension in your answer.

# Your code here ...

import numpy as np

def double_even_numbers(arr):
    
    result = np.array([x * 2 if x % 2 == 0 else x for x in arr])
    return result


inp_array = np.random.randint(0, 11, 100)
outp_array = double_even_numbers(input_array)


print("Input Array:\n", inp_array)
print("Output Array for Even Numbers Doubled:\n", outp_array)



# Q5: Read "movies.csv" file, a file is provided. Create a function
#  returns only table of elements before 2000 with score 7 and above, then save
#  the elements in a new csv file with a name "dest_csv". 

# Your code here ...


# Q6: Write a function of a name div_func. It returns the divsion of elements
#  in a list in reversed order. The function should pass the two lists below
#  without errors.

import random
random.seed(42)
short_list = [1, 0, 2, 2, 20]
long_list = [random.randrange(0, 10, 1) for i in range(15)]

# Your code here ...
